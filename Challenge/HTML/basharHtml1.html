<h2><u>second thing:</u></h2>
<h3>2003â€“2006:<mark> Thefacebook, </mark>Thiel investment, and name change</h3>
<p><i>Zuckerberg built a website called <q>Facemash</q> in 2003 while attending Harvard University.<br>
 The site was comparable to Hot or Not and used "photos compiled from the online facebooks of nine Houses,<br>
placing two next to each other at a time and asking users to choose the "hotter" person".<br>
 Facemash attracted 450 visitors and 22,000 photo-views in its first four hours.<br>
The site was sent to several campus group list-servers, but was shut down a few days later by Harvard administration.<br>
 Zuckerberg faced expulsion and was charged with breaching security, violating copyrights and violating individual privacy. 
 Ultimately, the charges were dropped.[14] Zuckerberg expanded on this project that semester by creating a social study tool ahead of an art history final exam.
 <br> He uploaded all art images to a website, each of which was accompanied by a comments section, then shared the site with his classmates.</i></p>
